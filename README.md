Note : This for Stenography python project


A normal person can send a message to an person by simple text. As an attacker can see the text by many attacking and spying methodologies such as Man-in-the-middle attack , spyware ,malware, etc. But as an Cybersecurity student we can use steganography to hide the secret text to bypass attacker vision. So to overcome come this we used Image steganography. Steganography is used in multiple media such as image, audio, cd ,etc.  We used here as Image Steganography.

So you need there a image where you can hide the text from anyone
